## Hi, I'm Ben

I'm a software engineer passionate about building clean, maintainable solutions. I transitioned into development through the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp after earning my mechanical engineering degree from UBC and working as an engineer for several years.
I work primarily with React, Node.js, and MySQL, contributing to full-stack applications and always looking to improve through code reviews and learning new patterns. I enjoy tackling complex problems and shipping features that provide real value.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me surfing, snowboarding, or playing guitar.
